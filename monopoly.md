## Classic Game

### House Rules

#### The Eternal Game

If your by-the-rules games of Monopoly end too quickly, use the rules that people who don't know the rules play by.

1. Do not auction off a property if a player lands on it and chooses not to buy it. It remains unowned until someone lands on it and chooses to buy it.
1. All taxes and Community Chest and Chance fees paid to the bank are placed on the Free Parking space. When someone lands on Free Parking, they take any money on that space.

### Variants

#### Strip Monopoly

These rules are designed to be as gender non-specific as possible.

##### Setup

1. Each player starts with $750 in cash.
1. Each player should be wearing:
    1. Top (e.g. shirt)
    1. Bottom (e.g. pants, skirt)
    1. Underwear (e.g. briefs, bra)

##### Play

For purposes of this game, Top, Bottom, and Underwear are the only articles of clothing that matter and apply no matter how many pieces of actual clothing comprise each. For example, a jacket, two shirts, and a bath robe are just a single Top. They must be removed together.

1. Clothing value
    1. Top is worth $200
    1. Bottom is worth $300
    1. Underwear is worth $1000
1. You may, at any time, mortgage your clothing to the bank for half its value in cash. Mortgaged clothing goes in a pile next to you.
1. On your turn, you may unmortgage clothing with 10% interest, just like property. However, you must play a full turn between the time you mortgage clothing and the turn in which you unmortgage it. In other words, you are not allowed to unmortgage clothing in the same turn in which you mortgage it or in the next turn after you mortgage it. Once you unmortgage clothing, you are free to wear it again.
1. You may sell your clothing to the bank for cash or remove it to pay another player full or partial rent at the full value of the clothing. The other player receives no cash for the portion you pay with clothing. The other player does not have to give you change, if the value of the clothing is more than the cost of the rent.  Your clothing is then removed from the game. No one, including you, may wear it until the game is over.
1. Mortgaged clothing has no value other than being available to be unmortgaged. You may not sell it to the bank, nor may you use it to pay rent.
1. When selling, paying with, or mortgaging clothing, it must be removed in the order Top then Bottom then Underwear.
1. Clothing may be unmortgaged in any order.
