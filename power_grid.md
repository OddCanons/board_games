### House Rules

#### Resource Demand

The standard rules provide a catch up mechanism by allowing players to purchase resources in reverse player order. This house rule makes for a more cut-throat game, in which bigger players have more power in the resource market. It takes longer, but feels more like a commodity market.

1. In Phase 3: Buying Resources...
1. For each resource type do the following procedure, one resource type at a time, in the order:
    1. Uranium
    1. Garbage
    1. Oil
    1. Coal
1. Players, in reverse player order, commit to purchasing resources worth a number of Elektro. They state the amount of Elektro and place that amount in front of them on the table.
1. Players purchase that resource in the order of Elektro committed, from highest to lowest, with ties resolved in reverse player order.
1. Players must buy resources of the type to which they have committed.
1. They must buy as many resources as they can with the committed Elektro.
1. They may not buy resources worth more than the Elektro they committed. In other words, a player is not allowed to add Elektro to buy resources that don't fit within their original commitment.
1. Players keep any unspent Elektro they committed, but may not commit them to other resource types in this phase.
1. For example, a player commits 11 Elektro to Uranium, but when their turn to buy comes up Uranium starts at 6. They can't buy Uranium on spaces 6 and 7, for a total of 13 Elektro, so they buy the Uranium resource on space 6. They keep the remaining 5 Elektro they committed to Uranium, but cannot use it to commit to or to purchase Garbage, Oil, or Coal in this phase.
