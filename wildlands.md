### House Rules

#### Equal Number of Turns

Check for the Game End win conditions only after all players have had an equal number of turns.

1. Before the first player (determined at Setup) would take each of their turns, check to see if any player has five points or if any player has lost all of their characters.
1. If either end condition is met, the player with the most points wins.
1. If there is a tie, players keep taking turns until one player is the only player with characters remaining or one player has more points than the others when the first player's turn comes up.
